# Repository Scale Up/Scale Out (WP2)
To create a critical mass of well curated, international repositories within the AIRR Data Commons, each with 100s of millions or billions of annotated sequences, that are of scientific significance to the general AIRR Community. To be in the position to “scale-out” the AIRR Data Commons repository network to 10s or 100s of independent federated repositories at the end of the project.

There will be three key deliverables from this work package:
1.	The development and application of techniques to increase the amount of AIRR-seq data (and its related metadata) in a single AIRR Repository (Scale Up).
2.	The expansion of the AIRR Data Commons to include six scientifically significant new repositories (Scale Out), increasing to ten the number of repositories in the AIRR Data Commons. 
3.	The development of an AIRR Data Repository software stack that will enable the AIRR Community to easily download, install, curate data, and add repositories to the AIRR Data Commons (Scale Out).
